A short game inspired by celeste and super mario. I created it for my the fifth birthday of my niece Magort-Béatrice. It focus on simplicity and has been made for a fifth year old playing his first platformer ever. The game is localize in french and english.

# Preface

# Engine
The game has been made with Godot 3.X. The dialogues are managed with my custom dialogue editor [Le Dialogue Editor](https://github.com/Levrault/LE-dialogue-editor). The app is kinda ok, could be better.
