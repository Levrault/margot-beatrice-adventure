	/* The main meat of the shader.
	Calculates a displacement using the bulge factor and the function,
	then divides the x by it. 
	
	If the displacement is larger than 1, the uv.x will become smaller, and, in
	the process, when the uv is used for sampling, a pixel more towards the
	middle of the texture will be sampled instead. This causes far UV values to
	now be able to have a correspondent pixel in the [-1, 1] range (that will
	be unmapped back to [0,1] later), "pulling out" the OG texture.
	 
	An inverted process occurs with displacement smaller than 1:
	uv.x becomes larger -> pixels move away from middle -> 
	inner values sample from farther away -> texture gets "pulled in"
	
	This also has the bonus of causing certain pixels to sample values  1,
	which will be caught by the if statement below and be rendered transparent.
	
	Remember as well that the x factor causes the UV to go from -2 to 2 on the x
	axis.
